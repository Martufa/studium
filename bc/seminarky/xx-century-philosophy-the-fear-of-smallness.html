The fear of smallness
An excurse into the mind of a small nation’s citizen
Introduction
No one man is created the same. Although born free and equal in our dignity and rights, we differ in our social privileges and benefit from the various talents we have been born with (or suffer for their lack). This holds true about states as well: some inherit the riches of their motherland, the spoils of wars far gone, the supportive neighbours and reliable partners for trade; others are left to deal with social turbulence, lack of natural resources, the constant threat of war or invasion, small influence based on trade or cultural export and so on.
As the circumstances differ, so must the choices of any individual or a state. And, in the ideal world, these decisions ought to be aligned with the correct assessment of reality. As we live in a democracy, it will be my main aim to focus on how these facts are gathered from the standpoint of those who make the decisions in our society - the people. I propose we attempt to see the world from the rational stance of a well-meaning yet sceptical citizen whom we may refer to as "the Patriot".

The factors in determining significance and self-protection: the facts :)
As we have mentioned, every nation is different in its resources and thus must be industrious about its methods of self-preservation. Every resource a nation has at its disposal serves one ultimate purpose: to assure the existence of the nation. Should we accept this premise, it is self-evident that the safeguard of its sovereignty plays a key role.
Let us turn our attention to the several key factors in determining the significance and self-protection of a nation.
Economic influence
The economy is the backbone of a functional society. One may not hold onto power by pure dedication, the financial reward is substantial for keeping the order in a state. Similarly, it is required for building infrastructure, maintaining the military and keeping the quality of life of the population high.
As important as the aforementioned reasons for a good economy are, there is one which is also important: having the economic power, the nation can to an extent rely on security created via trade embargos, sanctions and so on. It has the chance to influence the behaviour and hence can be protected by the sheer volume of disadvantages any aggression against it would generate.
Military power
Military power is usually the first factor to consider when discussing the protection of sovereignty, for a good reason: the threat of the outside is the easiest to imagine and grasp. Without sufficient resources in this category, a nation will not be able to withstand an invasion or an infringement of its borders.
Diplomatic relationships and cultural export
In this category, it is the connection between states (and their people) which holds the highest significance. Diplomatic relationships are not always disclosed to the public yet they have the power to accelerate the development of infrastructure and assure collaboration, trade and in the best case scenario even allies to call upon.
The cultural export influences the public perception of the nation - were the nation practically unknown to the world, would even a single soul bat an eye upon its disappearance? The cultural influence is highly dependent on the diplomatic relationships as the public of democratic countries elects their representatives. Should the public stand behind a foreign nation, so will the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 

Even though we have seen a small nation induce the first event in a chain of events (such as with the incident of duke’s Franz Ferdinand’s murder in Kosovo at the start of world war 1) these are not only rarities, the events tend not to be about the small nation (just as in the example).
All of these factors are interdependent and, undoubtedly, the larger the population, the stronger its influence. Consequently, we can assume the relative insignificance of the small nation. This begs the question: How does the small nation protect itself? 
It sees the enemy long before it strikes and uses the knowledge to be ready.
Kundera’s notion that the existence of the small nation is always in peril and it might well be his thoughts on it being doomed to subjugation by the larger power may have some merits. Yet this prevalent danger does not seem to morph its people into a nation of hard-working citizens, rather, it leads many to a sceptical approach to their environment. If you know you could be taken advantage of by everyone, how can you trust anyone? The small nation must be wary of the predators lurking in the shadows, awaiting the fortunate moment. And thus, in seeing danger everywhere, by constantly being on guard, the nation is quick to identify potential allies as vultures.
Yet it is not on the battlefield where the good citizen is looking for the vultures, the war is no longer waged solely there. Nowadays, it is waged in the minds and the hearts of the people as well. This is generally known under the term “the hybrid war”.
With this in mind, let us approach the following question: Whom can the Patriot trust?

A friend or a foe?
The Patriot hereby knows that someone might be trying to win over his opinion, and needs to ask the following: “Of whom and of what institutions should I be wary?” Of those which influence the happenings in the country the most, ergo, those that are generally considered trustworthy and of those that hold power.
As such, it is only logical to reject the propositions and news from the mainstream media, the experts and the politicians (all those whose voice has merit in the regular society).

The quest for knowledge
Once the Patriot is truly sceptical of all sources of information which might be reliable, there are only two options for them. They can remain proudly uninformed, believing it to be better than falling for the trick of those in power, or they can seek out a new source of information on their own and embark on a quest for an alternative source of information.
This is an opening for all those who are willing to twist the mind of the Patriot who has been praising themselves (so far silently) for their independent thinking. Should anyone seek to abuse such sentiment and infuse their mind with the feeling of martyrdom, of “the others being sheeple, blind to the truth”, they can easily do so. By doing this, the us-versus-them dynamic is created and the bond between the manufacturers of the truth and the Patriot is strengthened.
Another way to encourage the trust is to provide the Patriot with similar opinions as he or she already holds. It panders to the desire to be right and by extension to the confirmation bias.
Now that the Patriot believes they have finally found a reliable source of truth, they might be provided with a version of the truth. It is crucial that this truth is never too complicated, the Patriot must always understand exactly what is being said. It is only sensible to presume that that which we do not understand (and which is “inconceivably complicated and would take years of expertise to comprehend”) hides more lies and deceptions than that which we fully understand. This applies especially if we decompose the argumentation into small logical steps and every single step (in and of itself) is plausible (regardless of how ridiculous the conclusion might be).
One might ask: to what end would anyone try to win the trust of our Patriot?
Possible reasons might be many, I would assume the most common are these:
Actual belief
We cannot discard the possibility of the person behind the alternative news fully believing the information they spread and only attempting to make the world a better place. In such instances, the Patriot would be correct in their hopes for a candid source of information - candid, yet unprofessional and misguided. As such, they can be unintentionally harmful and in their nature influenced by those with less altruistic intentions.
Profit
To feed the Patriot lies, gain their trust and consequently abuse this trust for one’s own benefit, this might be considered another reason for spreading misinformation . Even though it is deeply immoral to see a man scammed of their savings (and much of their precious time being sacrificed to spread the belief), the last reason we will discuss holds an even darker and more sinister tone.
Influence
This might be a personal influence, the need to manipulate others or that of which our Patriot was initially afraid of, that which made them turn away from the regular society: the foreign superpowers trying to win the hearts and minds of the people of the small nation to influence the happenings. And to win the war before it ever happens.
Thus we enter a strange situation: people out of the sensible fear of being manipulated seek refuge in the arms of those who are trying to manipulate. Consequently (and quite ironically), the Patriot is refusing the reports of the state-owned security agencies (such as BIS) that warn about foreign propaganda of the alternative sources of information, seeing them as the propaganda. 

The twisted self-perception and the relative irrelevance of size
The specific way of thinking typical for the small nation (and by extension for any small group) is not necessarily determined by its size but rather by its self-perception. Should citizens of a nation perceive it as small and uninfluential (and likely to be under a threat), they will act accordingly. What do we mean by the actions typical of a small nation? And how does the feeling of smallness threaten democracy itself?

The danger of feeling endangered
The small nation (or any group which perceives itself as small) tends to act as if no one is watching to help, only to rule. Thus, it gives itself the permission to act unethically - it needs to take care of itself first. Simultaneously, there is no feeling of being ashamed because there is no one who would hold the group accountable for its actions. Again the Patriot believes no one is watching. 
And thus, the Patriot (in the attempt to protect their country) turns against the enemies. Against those who are supposedly threatening them, against those who were lying to their faces or doing them an injustice. Their rage turns against the institutions which serve them, their prosperity and safety.
We can see such a division on every level of our society:
Let us take Brexit into consideration. The United Kingdom (all the while not being a pure recipient of European grants) was benefiting from the Union. Yet, during the election campaign, its people were led to believe the country to be small in the grand scheme of things: as if it did not have any control over its borders, over its trade and so on. This is the thinking the Patriot has to do to uncover the enemies, even when there are none. I would argue it was ultimately the self-perception of smallness which led to the disastrous situation which Brexit proved to be.
For a recent example on a smaller scale, we might want to examine the threats made to doctors and physicians in the Czech Republic during the pandemic. Even though doctors themselves have no influence on the results of the tests for covid-19 nor for the regulations from the government, and have sworn the oath not to harm the patient, they have tasted the rage of the misinformed Patriot. Why? The Patriot here is a part of a group which basks in the sentiment of being oppressed (and at times of their martyrdom), their way of life being disregarded. This observation is on point, yet it excludes the crude reality that everyone’s way of life has been restricted by the pandemic. Still, being convinced that one is being oppressed and in the minority has enough power to generate the effects of perceived smallness which harms society.
To win the popular opinion is rarely that which drives the hybrid war. It is to spread misinformation, to divide…for that which is divided cannot rule itself and may easily be influenced or conquered. The Patriot, hoping to do the right thing, ends up threatening the very fabric of democracy.

Closing thoughts
In this essay, I have attempted to understand those who feel threatened by the smallness of their nation (or of their in-group). However, the question of man’s nature is too vast to be fully explored in one essay. The stances of the Patriot are explaining the divergent tendencies of groups that are generally regarded as extremist yet regard themselves as morally superior or patriotic. This leads to the final question:
What strategies ought to be applied in an attempt to counter the negatives and mitigate the risk of our democracies crumbling into dust?
I would not be writing with my conscience clean if I boldly proclaimed to know the solution to this crisis. In the following paragraph, I will only attempt to denote that which I believe might be helpful.
1) The information and those in power
The world is complicated, yet we must learn to convey ideas and happenings in such a way that the general public understands. That way, the number of people falling for the chimaera of the black-and-white world of propaganda may hopefully drop. The information has to be transparent, accessible and easy to understand, the same goes for education. Simultaneously, we ought to teach and learn to assess the world as is: to know to estimate the size and influence of (and the real threat to) any one nation or a group.
It is not the lack of information our society suffers from, it is the lack of knowledge about how to interpret it.
2) Trust
Trust is reciprocal and in most cases, it regards events that have not happened yet. If we are to ask for the trust of those who have been, by their rightful scepticism and fear (not by their stupidity!) positioned on the other side of the barricade, we ought to try to have trust they can make rational decisions.
Listen, try to find the common ground and understand. Let no fellow citizen be your enemy.
3) The assurance
If we have a reason to believe we are interconnected and that someone is watching not only with a sinister intent but also to provide a lending hand, we might well gain the security and the feeling of the interconnectedness of the world. Thus, I believe it’d be beneficial to approach each other with empathy and understanding in the time of need, rather than with mockery, and, just as importantly, to openly discuss the kind deeds of others (be it of other nations or of those with polarised opinions).
The fight against feeling small, fractured, threatened and divided cannot be fought with arguments nor weapons. It has to be fought with every-day small kindness.
